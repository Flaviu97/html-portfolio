        <p>My role at Pear Technology was Software Developer, which included tasks such as assisting with the design, code and testing of new features, investigating fault reports and implementing changes agreed upon request. While working at Pear, I was given the opportunity to assist in representing the company at the farm innovation show in Birmingham, where I spoke to potential clients. I was asked to prepare and lead a meeting on Google meet, where I created a testing document for a multitude of features and a short presentation on how they worked.</p>
